# Alerting via Kibana UI

The OpenDistro open source [repository](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/) provides a way to provide alerting via the Kibana UI.  

The alerting plugins are version specific so I needed to downgrade my elastic and kibana platforms to 7.1.1 (the latest version the plugins support)

There are two alerting plugs require for alerting support in the Kibana UI-- one for elastic and one for kibana.  See (doc link).
